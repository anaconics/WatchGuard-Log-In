WatchGuard-Log-In
=================

Keeps you logged into watchguard despite others trying to log in with your id

I live in hostel. And as everyone knows there are several ids on watchguard that let you surf the web without 

restrictions. I love youtube but sadly my id doesn't allow my to stream videos. However I got my hands on an id that'll

allow me to do anything I want. The problem is that some of my friends know this id, and if 2 people are logged in with the

same id, the last person who logged in will get internet access while the other one gets disconnected, i.e only one user

can be logged on at one time.

So I decided to make a script, to keep refreshing that page, and if anyone decides to log in with that id, they'll

automatically disconnect within seconds due to my script.

I'm obviously not going to give out my username and password, but to run this script simply enter your user name and 

password at the places mentioned in the program.
